## Last Week In Review
I got the news last week that I would be entering _hybrid crew rotations_ this week, which feels like a big step forward. Three days per week pairing on crew work, two days per week working solo on protege work. So from now on anything listed under 'To-Do This Week' will only include the protege work planned for those two days.

Last week I completed my Tic Tac Toe server/React app and began learning about CI/CD pipelines, Buildkite and AWS. We also created a Trello board for the three of us with cards for me to work on which is working very well. It's helping me stay on track while doing my work, as well as giving me other things to consider that I might not have come across otherwise.

All in all, pretty stoked with where I'm at in the program.

## To-Do This Week
- [`Serving a web app from S3`](https://trello.com/c/S7FfX3TT)
- [`Draw what the MYOB op-buildkite tool actually deploys`](https://trello.com/c/WZOt1cNv)

## AWS CLI
`aws s3 mb s3://<bucket-name>`
Creates a bucket
`aws s3 cp <local-file> s3://<bucket-name>`
Copies file to bucket
`aws s3 cp . s3://<bucket-name> --recursive`
Copies folders and files to bucket
`aws s3 ls` 
Lists _all_ buckets
`aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>`
Lists all objects in bucket
`aws s3 sycn . s3://<bucket-name>`
Syncs bucket with everything in current working directory
`aws s3 website s3://<bucket-name> --index-document <index.html> --error-document <index.html>`
Configures a bucket as a static website
`aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> --policy file://<policy-file-path>`
Sets bucket policy to given policy

## Bash Scripts
A sample bash script:
```
#!/bin/bash
# description of the script
echo Hello World
```

#### #! (shebang)
The first line of the bash script, the shebang (`#!`) is followed by the path to the interpreter that should be used to run the rest of the lines in the file (in this case, bash).

To run a bash script use `./scriptname.sh`.

#### Extras
`chmod +x filename` adds execute permissions to the file.
`output >> file.txt` adds output to file.txt
`output > file.txt` overwrites file.txt with output
