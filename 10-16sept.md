## To-Do This Week
- Make TTT shippable ❌
- More testing ❌
- Clean up of unused code ❌
- Project structure ❌


## Casting
Casting is turning one object type into another type.
### Upcasting
Upcasting (or widening) is casting from a more defined subclass into a broad superclass. 
```java
public class Animal {
    ...
 }
 
 public class Cat extends Animal {
    public void eat(){
        ...
    }
    public void meow(){
        ...
    }
 }
 
 Cat cat = new Cat();
 Animal animal = cat; // implicit casting, 
 // could be written explicitly as animal = (Animal) cat;
 ```
 In the above example `animal`, although it references a `Cat` type, is restricted to the methods available to the `Animal` type.
 ```java
cat.meow() // will work
animal.meow() // will not work
```
#### Polymorphism
```java
public class AnimalFeeder {
    public void feed(List<Animal> animals){
        animals.forEach(animal -> {
            animal.eat();
        });
    }
}
```
The above object `AnimalFeeder` doesn't care whether it is passed a `Dog` or a `Cat`, in the `feed()` method they are all `Animal`. Implicit upcasting occurs when we add objects of a type that is a subclass of `Animal` to the Animals list.
```java
List<Animal> animals = new ArrayList<>();
animals.add(new Cat());
animals.add(new Dog());
new AnimalFeeder().feed(animals);
```
In this case, `Cat` and `Dog` are both polymorphic because while they are Cats and Dogs, they are also Animals.


### Downcasting
The opposite of upcasting, downcasting (or narrowing) converts from a broad superclass into a more defined subclass.
Uses syntax `((subclass) superclass)`.
```java
public void feed(List<Animal> animals){
    animals.forEach(animal -> {
        animal.eat();
        }
        if(animal instanceof Cat) {
            ((Cat) animal).meow();
        }
    })
}
```
The broader Animal class (or any derivative of the Animal class) can now access the specific `cat.meow()` method. Downcasting is often used in conjunction with the `instanceof` operator.
The danger of downcasting is that if an object is cast to an unrelated type, such as `Animal` to `int`, it will throw a `ClassCastException`, which is only detectable at runtime.

## Git
### Git Diff
`git diff` is used alongside `git status` and `git log` to analyze the current state of a repo. It is a function that takes two data sets as input and outputs the changes between them. Diff will only output the sections of the data that have changes, not the entire data set itself. `git diff` without a specific file reference will show the changes for the entire repository since the last commit. To see the changes in a specific file use `git diff ./path/to/file`. To compare two branches use `git diff branch1..branch2`.

### Changing the Last Commit
Using the `amend` flag modifies the most recent commit. It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating a new one. It can also be used to change the message of the previous commit.
- `git commit --amend` to add staged changes to previous commit
- `git commit --amend -m "message"` will add staged changes and change the commit message

### Working With a Remote Repo
#### Making a PR
- Clone repo locally
- Make branch
- Make changes
- Push branch to remote with `git push --set-upstream`
- Open PR on Github

#### Fixing Merge Conflicts
- Pull the new master changes
- Checkout to feature branch
- `git rebase master`
- Fix _all_ conflicts in code
- `git push -f` to force push changes to remote branch

### Upstream Branches
Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch, called an upstream branch. If trying to push an existing local branch to a remote repo with no matching upstream branch, create a matching remote branch using `git push --set-upstream [branch-name]`. To create a local branch and upstream remote branch at the same time, use `git checkout --track origin/[branch-name]`.

### Rebasing
Rebasing keeps a linear history of the repo. It takes the changes made in a feature branch and tries to apply them onto the newly updated master branch. Rebasing is a _destructive operation_ and re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.

#### The Golden Rule of Rebasing
*Don't rebase on a public branch.*

#### Interactive Rebasing
`git rebase -i` gives you the opportunity to alter individual commits during the process of rebasing. You can also change the order in which the commits will be applied.

### Commands to Remember:
- `git commit -v` - open in vim for verbose comments
- `git commit --amend` to amend last commit with current changes
- `git diff`, `git status`, `git show`, `git log` to check current state of repo
