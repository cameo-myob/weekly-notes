## To-Do This Week
- Test as much as I can by Thursday ✅
- Project structure (?????) ✅
- Advanced TTT: make a web interface (ongoing)
- Figure out what technologies to use for above ✅
- Identify changes needed to make code work with web client (ongoing)
- How to display welcome message with player names (ongoing)

## Factory Pattern
- Abstract creator class allows you to create an instance of a creator with specific purpose
- Concrete creator handles creating concrete products that comply to interface set by abstract creator

#### Further Reading:
- Head First Design Patterns book

## Abstract Classes vs Interfaces
- Abstract classes describe what an object _is_, interfaces describe what an object _does_. (e.g "A is a B" vs "A is capable of doing B")

## Java HTTP Server
**Package from Sun (com.sun.net.httpserver), which means it may not be supported in other versions of Java**
### Simple Server
```java
package com.company;

import com.sun.net.httpserver.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8000), 0);
        HttpContext context = server.createContext("/test");
        context.setHandler(Main::handleRequest);
        server.start();
    }

    private static void handleRequest(HttpExchange exchange) throws IOException {
        printRequestInfo(exchange);
        String response = "{\"message\": \"Hello World\"}";
        exchange.getResponseHeaders().set("Content-Type:", "application/json;");
        exchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.getBytes().length);
        OutputStream os = exchange.getResponseBody();
        os.write(response.getBytes());
        os.close();
    }
}
```
### HttpServer
- Takes an IP address/port number and listens for incoming TCP connections on the address
- `HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(port), 0)`
- `InetSocketAddress` implements an IP Socket Address, which is an immutable object used by sockets for binding or connecting
- `server.start()` starts the server in a background thread

### HttpContext 
- Maps between a root URI path and `HttpHandler` to handle the requests for that path
- `createContext(path)` method on the `HttpServer` will create a `HttpContext` without specifying a handler
- `HttpContext context = server.createContext("/path")`
- To set a handler, call `setHandler()` method on `HttpContext`
- `context.setHandler(HttpHandler handler)`
- `createContext(path, handler)` method on `HttpServer` will create a `HttpContext` and set the handler
- `HttpContext context = server.createContext("/path", pathHandler)`
        
### HttpExchange
- Provides methods for examining a request from the client and for building/sending the response
- Typical life-cycle is:
    - `getRequestMethod()` to determine the request type (GET/POST etc)
    - `getRequestHeaders()` to examine headers if necessary
    - `getRequestBody()` returns an `InputStream` for reading the request body. Call `InputStream.close()` after.
    - `getResponseHeaders()` to set response headers, except content-length
    - `sendResponseHeaders(statusCode, responseLength)` to send the response headers, must be called before:
    - `getResponseBody()` to get an `OutputStream` to send the response body. When the response body has been written, the stream must be closed to terminate the exchange

## Braindump
- AWS is confusing
- What does `module-info.java` do?
- [`::` is a Method Reference but what tf does it do?](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-double-colon-operator)
- Figure out how InputStream/OutputStream works
- Servers are fun though
