## Last Week In Review
I didn't get as much completed last week as I had hoped. I picked up React last Monday, assuming that since I had used it in my bootcamp it would be the easiest thing to use for the front end of my server. I didn't realise how difficult switching from Java to React would be and spent most of Monday trying to remember/re-learn how React worked.

By late Tuesday I had a front end that could `POST` to my server _in theory_. In practice, it was throwing me a very non-specific possibly-CORS-but-not-actually-CORS-caused error. A wild goose chase ensued for Wednesday and Thursday, by which stage I was almost ready to end my developer career early and rejoin the land of retail work. The front end wouldn't `POST` to my server, but Postman would post just fine. _Why?_

It wasn't until late Friday afternoon, after spending the morning away from my code that I realised exactly what the problem was. The way I had my server handling requests wouldn't be able to process an `OPTIONS` request - which is why the browsers thought it was a CORS error. Postman doesn't send `OPTIONS` before sending a `POST`, which explains why Postman was succeeding while my React frontend was failing. A two minute fix (with an `if` statement for now) had solved a problem that took me three days to identify.

After a rough week I ended it on a high. I had a working server that allowed me to post Players from a React front end. One step closer to web Tic Tac Toe!
