## Last Week In Review
First week of crew rotations! I spent Monday and Tuesday pairing with Irina on some front end work for a self-service 2FA recovery process, which was great fun. It seems like most of Arrakis work from home on Wednesdays, so I've decided to set Wednesdays as one of my Protege days. Probably Thursdays too, but that's flexible.

Thursday and Friday were the MYOB Hack Days, which were an interesting experience. It was great to see everybody get excited about the projects that they were making, it seemed like a great morale boost for everyone and there was some pretty cool tech involved.

## To-Do This Week
