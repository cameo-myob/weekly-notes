# Week Starting 17th September

- [To-Do This Week](#to-do-this-week)
- [Four Rules of Simple Design](#four-rules-of-simple-design)
- [Unix Philosophy](#unix-philosophy)
- [TTT Java Server](#ttt-java-server)
- [Braindump](#braindump)

## To-Do This Week
- Advanced TTT: make a web interface (ongoing)
- How to display welcome message with player names (ongoing)
- Identify the changes required to make existing TTT work with Java server (ongoing)
- Make the changes
- Worry about everything else later ✅
- Read up on Four Rules of Simple Design ✅

## Four Rules of Simple Design
_A good way to detect knowledge duplication is to ask what happens if we want to change something._

## Unix Philosophy
- Modularity: write simple parts connected by clean interfaces
- Clarity: clarity is better than cleverness
- Composition: design programs to be connected with other programs
- Separation: separate policy from mechanism, separate interfaces from engines
- Simplicity: design for simplicity, add complexity only where you must
- Parsimony: write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do
- Transparency: design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier
- Robustness: robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity
- Representation: fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust
    - _Where you see a choice between complexity in data structures and complexity in code, choose the former._
- Least Surprise: in interface design, always do the least surprising thing (also known as Principle of Least Astonishment)
- Silence: when a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing
- Repair: repair what you can - but when you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible
- Economy: programmer time is expensive, conserve ti in preference to machine time
- Generation: avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs where you can
- Optimisation: prototype before polishing, get it working before you optimise it
- Diversity: distrust all claims of _one true way_
- Extensibility: design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think

## TTT Java Server
_Make it work with Postman first, then worry about a front end._

Server changes required: 
- `/addplayer` route
- handler to create `Player` (maybe???)
- `/addmove` route
- handler to point to parser/`tttBoard.addMove()`

TTT changes required:
- the Game.gameLoop won't work as is
    - Game.gameLoop should only be for the console, web-based interface is event driven not loop driven
- Main won't work as is - need to move code out 

**What doesn't need to change?**
- InputValidator (only for console)
- Player
- Result
- UserMove
- WinChecker
- WinningCombination
- Any of the board stuff
- Really just Main and Game that need to change???


#### Further Reading:
- [JSON Parsing](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/json-1973242.html)

## Braindump
Questions to figure out:
- How to keep the game state?
- How to save the Player Name/Token?
- How to swap players?
- How to make game loop run on event?
- How to initially get player name/token?
- need something to parse JSON request to UserMove (_have console and web parsers_)
- number input on web version means user move will always be int, so no need to validate input - board checks for valid position anyway
- input validator to console package? _maybe_
- add player name/token to user move so it's all in one object? why should/shouldn't it?
- should the backend parse JSON to UserMove or should the game parse? _not the backend's problem_
- how to make the game compatible with both web stuff and console stuff?
- does the game loop live with the console stuff or still with the game? how do I split game and console?
- how do I test the server?
- `get player info` to move out of main - would only be used for console game
- `Game` constructor will need to change - can't take prompt or players for web???


### What Steps??
1. Separate Game loop code from Main.java ✅
2. Separate server start code from Main.java ✅
3. Main should run command to start game loop or start server to wait for http hits ✅
4. Move game loop back in to Game? ✅
5. `Game.start(type)` to start either the console loop or the web server? ✅
6. Merge Player and UserMove

### Game Flow
#### Console based TTT
- Get players
- Start Game.gameLoop
- While Result == Success || Error
    - Get `userInput`, to `InputValidator`, to `MoveParser`, to `board.addMoveToBoard()`, to `prompt.print()`, to `Main`

#### Web based TTT
- Start server
- Listen for requests
- Add players
- Request goes from `server`, to `JSON-UserMove parser`, to `board.addMoveToBoard()`, to `Result-JSON parser`, to `server` response

-------

Things I battled: 
- how the server worked
- how to draw the line between server and game
- how to convert json object to string array (I couldn't)
- how to convert json object to json array
- how to convert json array to string array
- what is serialization/deserialization??


What did I do?
- put game loop back in Game instead of Main
- created switch to control `CONSOLE` vs `SERVER`
- added token to UserMove, changed all cases where `UserMove` & `Player` were necessary
- made `JSONParser` to go from JSON request body to UserMove/board and from Result to JSON
- tried to separate things into relevant packages
- everything wrong
